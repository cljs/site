This release contains many bug fixes and addresses feedback from the 1.9.908
release. Important changes include parity with Clojure 1.9.0-beta1 and an
updated Google Closure Compiler dependency. The later one in particular now
means that ClojureScript has a dependency on JDK 8.

As always feedback welcome!

* CLJS-2300: Delegate clojure.string/capitalize to goog.string/capitalize
* CLJS-2374: Print js/Infinity, js/-Infinity, js/NaN using new reader literals
* bump tools.reader (1.1.0)
* CLJS-2372: update hash to use the new infinity literals
* CLJS-2364: Bump Closure Compiler to the Sep 2017 version
* CLJS-2340: Have js-keys delegate directly to good.object/getKeys
* CLJS-2338: Support renamePrefix{Namespace} closure compiler option
